URL replacement for HTML Webpack Plugin
=======================================



[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/replace-url-html-webpack-plugin.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/replace-url-html-webpack-plugin/)

This is an extension plugin for the [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) plugin [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) - a plugin that simplifies the creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles.

Typically, [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) injects `<script>` and `<link>` elements into generated HTML.
When used with a template, [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) will still inject new elements regardless of whether or not the necessary `<script>` elements already exist.

This plugin will automatically update the URLs for existing `<script>` and `<link>` elements in an HTML template with URLs generated by Webpack.
It identifies existing elements by comparing their URLs with the generated output file name from Webpack. See Example section.

Environment
-----------
* [node](https://nodejs.org/) >= 6.11.5

Dependencies
------------
* webpack ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)) ([github](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)) >= 4.0.0
* html-webpack-plugin ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin)) ([github](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin)) >= 3.2.0

Installation
------------
Install the plugin as a development dependency using npm:
```shell
$ npm install replace-url-html-webpack-plugin --save-dev
```

Basic Usage
-----------

The plugin has no configuration. Simply, add the plugin to your webpack config as follows:

```javascript
{
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
    new ReplaceUrlHtmlWebpackPlugin()
  ]
}
```

The order is important - the plugin must come **after** HtmlWebpackPlugin.

Example
-------

Consider the following HTML template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Example</title>
        <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/index.css" />
        <script async="async" src="js/bundle.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```

If webpack is configured to generate the bundle with a hash included, then the URLs for both `<script>` and `<link>` will be replaced:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title>Example</title>
        <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="css/index.abcdef0123456789.css" />
        <script async="async" src="js/bundle.abcdef0123456789.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        ...
    </body>
</html>
```
